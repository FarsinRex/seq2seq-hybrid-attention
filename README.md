# Attentive Seq2Seq 🚀
*Hybrid LSTM + Self-Attention Seq2Seq model with training loss visualization*

---

## 📌 Description
This project implements a custom **sequence-to-sequence model** that combines **LSTM recurrence** with **transformer-style self-attention**.  
It is designed to retain sequential information while also leveraging context-aware attention, making it useful for tasks like toy translation experiments and exploring attention mechanisms.

---

## ✨ Features
- Custom **Self-Attention layer** (implemented from scratch in Keras)
- **Hybrid Encoder–Decoder** with LSTM for sequence retention
- **Additive Attention** for decoder–encoder context
- Training pipeline with **loss visualization**
- Ready-to-use in **Google Colab**

---

## 🛠 Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/attentive-seq2seq.git
cd attentive-seq2seq

🚀 Usage:
Check out the notebooks/ folder for training in Colab.
Run the src/model.py script to build and train the model.
Modify input/target sentences in the script for experimentation.
